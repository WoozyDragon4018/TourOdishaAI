# TourOdishaAI (CLI)
Simple app using a small dataset (A remote MySQL server) and an LLM to create what becomes a Tour Agent for anyone looking to tour Odisha! Entirely community-driven so it even highlights some of the more underrated spots too!

## (!) This is a CLI - Command Line Interface prototype.
This will run entirely in your terminal. I tried to integrated PyQt5 but due to lack of time this is the best I could go for now. Rest assured, I'll skip over PyQt and make this universal by using a web-based interface.
